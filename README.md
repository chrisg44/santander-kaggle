# santander-kaggle

This is my Jupyter Notebook from my compeletion of the Santander Kaggle competiton - https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/data

The aim of this project was to demonstrate use of cloud computing, packaging code to enable running remotely.

To support this I also wrote a blog to provide a beginngers guide to using AWS. Can be found at:
